## About SLEAP
[SLEAP](https://sleap.ai) is an open source deep-learning based framework for multi-animal pose tracking. It can be used to track any type or number of animals. 

Key core features include: 
* Single- and multi-animal pose estimation with _top-down_ and _bottom-up_ training strategies
* State-of-the-art pretrained and customizable neural network architectures that deliver accurate predictions with very few labels

## About SLEAP-MATLAB



This repository contains an implementation and examples of how to use deep neural network models for pose estimation trained in [SLEAP](https://sleap.ai) to track multiple body parts of freely moving animals using the [MATLAB Deep Learning Toolbox](https://www.mathworks.com/products/deep-learning.html).
